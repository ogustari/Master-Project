# Master-Project

Group: Ian Sanders, DEE, Lausanne University (UNIL) 
Supervisor: Frederic Masclaux

Project: How do genetically different mycorrhizal fungi share roots?

Description: The aim of the project is to answer the princiapl question: How do genetically different mychorrhizal fungi share roots? Different isolates of _Rizhophagus irregularis_ will be used to answer the major question. In addition genes expression analysis in both plants and fungi will be performed to understand if co-inoculation of two isolates will affect the expression of specific genes (as the defences one in plants).  
The Master Project, is a research project proposed by the School of the Biology of the university of Lausanne during the second and third semestres of master. This project is hosted by Ian Sanders group at Department of Ecology and Evolution (DEE) of the Lausanne University (UNIL).
